<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About MagicClock

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

MagicClock is a specified variant of MagicCFG, adapted for use with Apple Watches.
It is intended to facilitate the work of repair technicians from around the world who do not have access to an expensive NAND programmer from the Far East. With MagicClock, we are supporters of the #rightToRepair movement and want to contribute to reducing e-waste worldwide.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
